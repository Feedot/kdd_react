Измерять температуру прибором Microlife MT 3001 можно тремя разными способами, исходя из того, какой больной нуждается в определении уровня его самочувствия. Модель Microlife MT 3001 производит измерение в течение нескольких минут, в зависимости от способа измерения и отображает полученный результат на жидкокристаллическом дисплее, а также оповещает звуковым сигналом, что измерение окончено. Опция автоматического отключения самопроизвольно выключит прибор Microlife MT 3001, оставив в ячейке памяти данные последнего измерения.\"\n}];\nexports.default = productCollection;\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 258 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n// removed by extract-text-webpack-plugin\n\n/***/ })\n/******/ ]);\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// build.js"," \t// The module cache\n \tvar installedModules = {};\n\n \t// The require function\n \tfunction __webpack_require__(moduleId) {\n\n \t\t// Check if module is in cache\n \t\tif(installedModules[moduleId]) {\n \t\t\treturn installedModules[moduleId].exports;\n \t\t}\n \t\t// Create a new module (and put it into the cache)\n \t\tvar module = installedModules[moduleId] = {\n \t\t\ti: moduleId,\n \t\t\tl: false,\n \t\t\texports: {}\n \t\t};\n\n \t\t// Execute the module function\n \t\tmodules[moduleId].call(module.exports, module, module.exports, __webpack_require__);\n\n \t\t// Flag the module as loaded\n \t\tmodule.l = true;\n\n \t\t// Return the exports of the module\n \t\treturn module.exports;\n \t}\n\n\n \t// expose the modules object (__webpack_modules__)\n \t__webpack_require__.m = modules;\n\n \t// expose the module cache\n \t__webpack_require__.c = installedModules;\n\n \t// define getter function for harmony exports\n \t__webpack_require__.d = function(exports, name, getter) {\n \t\tif(!__webpack_require__.o(exports, name)) {\n \t\t\tObject.defineProperty(exports, name, {\n \t\t\t\tconfigurable: false,\n \t\t\t\tenumerable: true,\n \t\t\t\tget: getter\n \t\t\t});\n \t\t}\n \t};\n\n \t// getDefaultExport function for compatibility with non-harmony modules\n \t__webpack_require__.n = function(module) {\n \t\tvar getter = module && module.__esModule ?\n \t\t\tfunction getDefault() { return module['default']; } :\n \t\t\tfunction getModuleExports() { return module; };\n \t\t__webpack_require__.d(getter, 'a', getter);\n \t\treturn getter;\n \t};\n\n \t// Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call\n \t__webpack_require__.o = function(object, property) { return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, property); };\n\n \t// __webpack_public_path__\n \t__webpack_require__.p = \"\";\n\n \t// Load entry module and return exports\n \treturn __webpack_require__(__webpack_require__.s = 62);\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// webpack/bootstrap 1386a9e782df11d9974b","'use strict';\n\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {\n  module.exports = require('./cjs/react.production.min.js');\n} else {\n  module.exports = require('./cjs/react.development.js');\n}\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./node_modules/react/index.js\n// module id = 0\n// module chunks = 0","/**\n * Copyright (c) 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\n */\n\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n  var REACT_ELEMENT_TYPE = (typeof Symbol === 'function' &&\n    Symbol.for &&\n    Symbol.for('react.element')) ||\n    0xeac7;\n\n  var isValidElement = function(object) {\n    return typeof object === 'object' &&\n      object !== null &&\n      object.$$typeof === REACT_ELEMENT_TYPE;\n  };\n\n  // By explicitly using `prop-types` you are opting into new development behavior.\n  // http://fb.me/prop-types-in-prod\n  var throwOnDirectAccess = true;\n  module.exports = require('./factoryWithTypeCheckers')(isValidElement, throwOnDirectAccess);\n} else {\n  // By explicitly using `prop-types` you are opting into new production behavior.\n  // http://fb.me/prop-types-in-prod\n  module.exports = require('./factoryWithThrowingShims')();\n}\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./node_modules/prop-types/index.js\n// module id = 2\n// module chunks = 0","/**\n * Copyright 2014-2015, Facebook, Inc.\n * All rights reserved.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.

Корпус модели Microlife MT 1931 GT оснащен достаточно большим дисплеем, на котором отображается результат измерения. Когда процесс измерения температуры закончен, термометр издает оповещающий сигнал и через некоторое время срабатывает опция автоматического отключения, предварительно сохранив последние данные в памяти. Благодаря водонепроницаемому корпусу, пользоваться моделью Microlife MT 1931 GT можно даже в условиях повышенной влажности, что никоим образом не повлияет на работоспособность прибора.\"\n    },\n    {\n        type:'other',\n        name:\"Gamma-t70\",\n        img:\"gammat70.jpg\",\n        price:250,\n        ammount:0,\n        text:\"Предназначен для измерения температуры тела оральным, ректальным и аксилярным способами Гибкий наконечник Измерение за 60 секунд 100% водонепроницаемый Звуковой сигнал Память Автоотключение для продления периода использования батарейки\"},\n    {\n        type:'other',\n        name:\"mt-3001\",\n        img:\"mt3001.jpg\",\n        price:230,\n        ammount:0,\n        text:\"Благодаря отсутствию ртути в модели Microlife MT 3001, пользоваться таким термометром безопасно и довольно просто. Термометр имеет пластиковый корпус с информационным экраном и удобный наконечник. Измерять температуру прибором Microlife MT 3001 можно тремя разными способами, исходя из того, какой больной нуждается в определении уровня его самочувствия. Модель Microlife MT 3001 производит измерение в течение нескольких минут, в зависимости от способа измерения и отображает полученный результат на жидкокристаллическом дисплее, а также оповещает звуковым сигналом, что измерение окончено. Опция автоматического отключения самопроизвольно выключит прибор Microlife MT 3001, оставив в ячейке памяти данные последнего измерения.\"\n    }\n]\nexport default productCollection;\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./src/js/productCollection.js"],"sourceRoot":""}
