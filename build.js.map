Измерять температуру прибором Microlife MT 3001 можно тремя разными способами, исходя из того, какой больной нуждается в определении уровня его самочувствия. Модель Microlife MT 3001 производит измерение в течение нескольких минут, в зависимости от способа измерения и отображает полученный результат на жидкокристаллическом дисплее, а также оповещает звуковым сигналом, что измерение окончено. Опция автоматического отключения самопроизвольно выключит прибор Microlife MT 3001, оставив в ячейке памяти данные последнего измерения.\"\n}];\nexports.default = productCollection;\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 252 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\n// removed by extract-text-webpack-plugin\n\n/***/ })\n/******/ ]);\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// build.js"," \t// The module cache\n \tvar installedModules = {};\n\n \t// The require function\n \tfunction __webpack_require__(moduleId) {\n\n \t\t// Check if module is in cache\n \t\tif(installedModules[moduleId]) {\n \t\t\treturn installedModules[moduleId].exports;\n \t\t}\n \t\t// Create a new module (and put it into the cache)\n \t\tvar module = installedModules[moduleId] = {\n \t\t\ti: moduleId,\n \t\t\tl: false,\n \t\t\texports: {}\n \t\t};\n\n \t\t// Execute the module function\n \t\tmodules[moduleId].call(module.exports, module, module.exports, __webpack_require__);\n\n \t\t// Flag the module as loaded\n \t\tmodule.l = true;\n\n \t\t// Return the exports of the module\n \t\treturn module.exports;\n \t}\n\n\n \t// expose the modules object (__webpack_modules__)\n \t__webpack_require__.m = modules;\n\n \t// expose the module cache\n \t__webpack_require__.c = installedModules;\n\n \t// define getter function for harmony exports\n \t__webpack_require__.d = function(exports, name, getter) {\n \t\tif(!__webpack_require__.o(exports, name)) {\n \t\t\tObject.defineProperty(exports, name, {\n \t\t\t\tconfigurable: false,\n \t\t\t\tenumerable: true,\n \t\t\t\tget: getter\n \t\t\t});\n \t\t}\n \t};\n\n \t// getDefaultExport function for compatibility with non-harmony modules\n \t__webpack_require__.n = function(module) {\n \t\tvar getter = module && module.__esModule ?\n \t\t\tfunction getDefault() { return module['default']; } :\n \t\t\tfunction getModuleExports() { return module; };\n \t\t__webpack_require__.d(getter, 'a', getter);\n \t\treturn getter;\n \t};\n\n \t// Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call\n \t__webpack_require__.o = function(object, property) { return Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty.call(object, property); };\n\n \t// __webpack_public_path__\n \t__webpack_require__.p = \"\";\n\n \t// Load entry module and return exports\n \treturn __webpack_require__(__webpack_require__.s = 52);\n\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// webpack/bootstrap bf6d2c0c58860b7351b3","'use strict';\n\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production') {\n  module.exports = require('./cjs/react.production.min.js');\n} else {\n  module.exports = require('./cjs/react.development.js');\n}\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./node_modules/react/index.js\n// module id = 0\n// module chunks = 0","/**\n * Copyright (c) 2013-present, Facebook, Inc.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the MIT license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.\n */\n\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {\n  var REACT_ELEMENT_TYPE = (typeof Symbol === 'function' &&\n    Symbol.for &&\n    Symbol.for('react.element')) ||\n    0xeac7;\n\n  var isValidElement = function(object) {\n    return typeof object === 'object' &&\n      object !== null &&\n      object.$$typeof === REACT_ELEMENT_TYPE;\n  };\n\n  // By explicitly using `prop-types` you are opting into new development behavior.\n  // http://fb.me/prop-types-in-prod\n  var throwOnDirectAccess = true;\n  module.exports = require('./factoryWithTypeCheckers')(isValidElement, throwOnDirectAccess);\n} else {\n  // By explicitly using `prop-types` you are opting into new production behavior.\n  // http://fb.me/prop-types-in-prod\n  module.exports = require('./factoryWithThrowingShims')();\n}\n\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./node_modules/prop-types/index.js\n// module id = 2\n// module chunks = 0","/**\n * Copyright 2014-2015, Facebook, Inc.\n * All rights reserved.\n *\n * This source code is licensed under the BSD-style license found in the\n * LICENSE file in the root directory of this source tree.
